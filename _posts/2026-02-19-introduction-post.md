### Things New to Me
- markdown files
- yml files
- github.dev
    - I used this to help organize my directories

### Parts I Struggled With
I struggled getting Jekyll to work. [Here's a link][jekyllrb] to the webpage we looked at in office hours.

### Parts That Don't Make Sense
It doesn't make sense why my mac can't run the C++ files that Jekyll needs.

### What I'm Looking Forward To
I'm looking forward to learning SQL and doing [lab 7][lab-7]!
